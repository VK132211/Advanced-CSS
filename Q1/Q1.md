In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the `var()` function is used to define and use custom CSS variables, also known as custom properties. Custom properties are user-defined variables that allow you to store and reuse values throughout your CSS code. The primary purpose of the `var()` function is to promote code reusability and make it easier to manage and maintain your styles by centralizing values that you may use in multiple places within your stylesheet.


1. **Defining Custom Properties:** To define a custom property, you use the `--` prefix followed by a unique name for your variable, like this:

   ```css
   :root {
     --main-color: #3498db;
   }
   ```

   In this example, we've defined a custom property `--main-color` with the value `#3498db`. The `:root` selector is used to declare the variable globally, making it accessible anywhere in the stylesheet.

2. **Using Custom Properties:** Once you've defined a custom property, you can use it within your CSS rules using the `var()` function. For example:

   ```css
   .header {
     background-color: var(--main-color);
   }
   ```

   In this case, the background color of the `.header` element will be set to the value of `--main-color`, which is `#3498db`.

The benefits of using the `var()` function and custom properties include:

1. **Modularity:** You can easily change a value in one place (the custom property definition) and have it automatically update in all the places where you use the `var()` function. This promotes code modularity and reduces the risk of errors caused by inconsistent values.

2. **Readability:** Custom properties provide meaningful names to your values, making your CSS more self-documenting and easier to understand.

3. **Maintainability:** If you want to make global style changes, you can update the value of the custom property in one location rather than searching through your stylesheet for all instances of a specific value.

4. **Dynamic Theming:** Custom properties can be manipulated using JavaScript, allowing for dynamic theming and user-customizable styles on websites.

In summary, the `var()` function in CSS is used to create and reference custom properties, making it easier to manage, maintain, and update your styles while promoting modularity and code readability.
